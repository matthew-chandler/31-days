# 31 Days
I'm doing a challenge where I make a new website each day during July 2025 as a way to test out code assistant capabilities, learn new tools, and have fun!

### Site Requirements
- must be standalone (i.e. have a unique domain)
- must be interactive
- must be live -- pages aren't useful unless hosted somewhere!

### What's allowed
- backend not required
- can be mostly or entirely vibe-coded
- can self-host or use a free hosting solution (e.g. Github pages)

### Demos

Learn more on [my website](https://www.machandler.com/31-days), which has links to each of the live sites. Each day I'll provide an update with a brief blurb, a link to the site, and the amount of time I spent making it (includes code generation, debugging, and deployment).
